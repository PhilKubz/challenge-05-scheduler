## Description

This project is a work day scheduler that allows users to plan and organize their daily tasks. Using JQuery and dayjs, we are able to help style and showcase some newly learned development skills!

## Implementation

The work day scheduler is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. jQuery is used for DOM manipulation and event handling. The schduler portion is dynamic and adjusts the stylong of the time blocks depending on the current time. This visual indication helps when viewing to see what events are past, present, and future. The user may input events for any time slot of their choosing which are then saved locally. This can be tested by refreshing the page, which then shows that the events persist even after the refresh!

## Usage

To use the work day scheduler, follow these steps:
1. Open the web page in your browser
2. The time blocks each have an input field where you can enter your task/event
3. Click the corresponding save button to store the task in local storage
4. The task/event will be saved and displayed even after refreshing the page
5. The styling of each time block will automatically update to indicate past(gray), present(red), and future(green) time slots
